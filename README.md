image and move viewer and uploader in html5
how to use: upload your images with the upload script  (the scripts must have write permission to the folder containing it ) or place them in the "root directory", and enjoy! 

----------
Important new feature: the images are now being resized to the user's screen size before being sent with make a more floating user experience and uses much less bandwith (and more CPU server side....)
