image and move viewer and uploader in html5
how to use: upload your images with the upload script  (the scripts must have write permission to the folder containing it ) or place them in the "root directory", and enjoy! 

(sorry if the code is unreadable, and the variables are like $ssss  = explode(" ",$sss); but i didn't have that much time when i wrote it and was too lazy ;))
